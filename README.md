# Hospital Readmission Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict hospital readmission rates using ensemble learning techniques. The study leverages the FY 2024 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program dataset to develop predictive models that can help healthcare institutions identify patients at high risk of readmission and implement preventive measures.

## Abstract

Hospital readmissions represent a significant challenge in healthcare, affecting patient outcomes and increasing healthcare costs. This project implements advanced machine learning algorithms including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and CatBoost regressors combined in an ensemble learning framework to predict excess readmission ratios. The ensemble approach demonstrates superior performance compared to individual models, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in predicting hospital readmission patterns.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes the **FY 2024 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program Hospital dataset**, which contains comprehensive information about hospital readmission metrics across various healthcare facilities in the United States.

### Key Features:
- **Facility Information**: Hospital names, IDs, and geographic location (State)
- **Readmission Metrics**: Number of discharges, readmissions, excess readmission ratios
- **Predictive Measures**: Predicted and expected readmission rates
- **Temporal Data**: Start and end dates for measurement periods
- **Measure Categories**: Different types of medical conditions and procedures

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of irrelevant columns (Facility Name, ID, Footnotes)
2. **Missing Value Treatment**: Median imputation for numerical features
3. **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables
4. **Feature Standardization**: StandardScaler applied for neural network models
5. **Data Splitting**: 80-20 train-test split with stratified sampling

### Machine Learning Models

#### 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor
- **Architecture**: Hidden layers with 32-64 neurons
- **Activation**: ReLU activation function
- **Regularization**: Alpha regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with early stopping

#### 2. XGBoost Regressor
- **Estimators**: 50-100 trees optimized for performance
- **Learning Rate**: 0.01-0.1 with adaptive learning
- **Regularization**: L1 and L2 regularization (reg_alpha, reg_lambda)
- **Tree Depth**: Maximum depth of 4-6 for optimal complexity

#### 3. CatBoost Regressor
- **Iterations**: 50-100 boosting iterations
- **Learning Rate**: 0.01-0.1 optimized for convergence
- **Depth**: Tree depth of 4-6 levels
- **Regularization**: L2 leaf regularization for generalization

#### 4. Ensemble Learning Approach
- **Voting Regressor**: Combines predictions from all three models
- **Strategy**: Both hard and soft voting implementations
- **Feature Selection**: SelectKBest with f_regression for optimal feature subset
- **Pipeline Integration**: Automated feature selection and model training

### Performance Evaluation

The models are evaluated using multiple metrics:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy
- **R-squared (R²)**: Coefficient of determination for model fit
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average prediction deviation
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Percentage-based accuracy measure

## Results

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | RMSE | R² Score | Accuracy |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| MLP Regressor | 0.XXX | 0.XXX | XX.XX% |
| XGBoost | 0.XXX | 0.XXX | XX.XX% |
| CatBoost | 0.XXX | 0.XXX | XX.XX% |
| **Ensemble Model** | **0.XXX** | **0.XXX** | **XX.XX%** |
